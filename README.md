# Stevenson
A document library template using Jekyll
***

Based on the default theme *minima 2.1.1*, but completely overridden and not currently gem-based.

Totally work in progress right now.

This may end up as a proper gem-based theme in the future, but in its current form this can be run as a stand-alone install. In fact, it can be previewed by forking into a GitHub repo branch named `gh-pages`.
